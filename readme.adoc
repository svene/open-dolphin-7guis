= 7 GUIs with OpenDolpin

Dierk KÃ¶nig discovered https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki[7 GUIs: A Notational Usability Benchmark for GUI Programming]
and we thought it would be great to have an OpenDolphin implementation of it.

For me not necessarily the notational usability aspect is important but to find a good OpenDolphin implementation.

So far I have implemented 3 of the GUIs. In the following blog posts I will explain
how I implemented them and what I have learned while doing it.

Some of the 7 GUIs are only concerned with UI toolkit functionality.
Since I want to focus on the ones which are more insteresting from an OpenDolphin point of view I skipped those for now.

For the client technology I decided to use JavaFX in a simple programmatic way and
I will try to find the time to do a HTML GUI in the future.

Since github supports Asciidoctor I decided to use that format for the descriptions of the individual examples,
which brings back the fun in writing and the documentation close to the code.


When you go through the descriptions I recommend that you look at the original description of
https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki[7 GUIs: A Notational Usability Benchmark for GUI Programming].

Here is the list of the currently implemented GUIs:
