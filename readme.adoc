= 7 GUIs with OpenDolpin

Dierk KÃ¶nig discovered https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki[7 GUIs: A Notational Usability Benchmark for GUI Programming]
and we thought it would be a great to have an OpenDolphin implementation of it.

For me not necessarily the notational usability aspect is important but to find a good OpenDolphin implementation.

So far I have implemented 3 of the GUIs. In the following blog posts I will explain
how I implemented them and what I have learned while doing it.

Some of the 7 GUIs are only concerned with UI toolkit functionality.
Since I want to focus on the ones which are more insteresting from an OpenDolphin point of view I skipped those for now.

For the client technology I decided to use JavaFX in a simple programmatic way and
I will try to find the time to do a HTML GUI in the future.

When you go through these blog post I recommend that you look at the original description of
https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki[7 GUIs: A Notational Usability Benchmark for GUI Programming]
because I will not repeat it's description here.

Here is the list of the currently implemented GUIs:
